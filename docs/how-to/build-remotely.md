# Build on a remote builder

You have a derivation and a machine that should build it. `iets build`
evaluates in memory and sends the builder only what it's missing, in one go.
iets keeps no local store, so nothing has to land in `/nix/store` first.

Every flag is in [Commands](../reference/commands.md). If you want to know why
the upload works this way, read
[The transports, measured](../explanation/transports.md). Why a fetched input
needs no trust is in
[How caching works](../explanation/caching.md).

The examples build `greeting.nix` from
[Get started with iets](../tutorial/getting-started.md). It reads
`builtins.currentSystem`, which a pure evaluation doesn't have, so the
commands add `--impure`.

## Pick a builder

`--builder URL` takes these forms:

```sh
iets build --impure --builder daemon greeting.nix
iets build --impure --builder unix:///nix/var/nix/daemon-socket/socket greeting.nix
iets build --impure --builder ssh-ng://builder.example.org greeting.nix
iets build --impure --builder grpc://farm.example.org:50051 greeting.nix
```

- `daemon` is this machine's socket, `/nix/var/nix/daemon-socket/socket`.
- `unix:///path` is any other socket that speaks the Nix worker protocol.
- `ssh-ng://[user@]host` runs `ssh host nix-daemon --stdio` and talks to it
  over its standard input and output. It reads `NIX_SSHOPTS`. To run
  another program on the host, add `?remote-program=CMD` to the URL.
- `grpc://host:port` is a
  [nix-grpc-store](https://github.com/Mic92/nix-grpc-store) service. You don't
  need `nix`, a plugin or a local store.

Without the flag, iets uses the `builder` setting in your user `iets.toml`,
and if that's unset, `store` from `nix.conf`. To set it for one run without
the flag:

```sh
iets --iets-option builder ssh-ng://builder.example.org build --impure greeting.nix
```

iets refuses a daemon older than protocol 1.35.

## Set the parameters of a gRPC builder

A `grpc://` URL takes nix-grpc-store's own query parameters. These are the
ones you'll most likely need. The rest are in
[Builders and the wire](../reference/builders.md#url-parameters):

```sh
iets build --impure --builder 'grpc://farm.example.org:50051?token-file=/run/secrets/farm-token' greeting.nix
```

| parameter | default | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `token-file` | none | a file holding an OIDC bearer token, re-read for every call. Needs TLS |
| `client-cert`, `client-key` | none | a PEM client identity for mTLS. Both or neither |
| `system` | the `system` setting | which worker cluster the balancer routes to |
| `max-builds` | 64 | concurrent builds in flight |
| `insecure` | `false` | plaintext instead of TLS, for local testing only |

Without credentials, the first call fails, and says why:

```
error: gRPC StoreInfo on 'farm.example.org:50051' failed (Unauthenticated):
       server requires a TLS client certificate or bearer token
hint: TLS handshake failed and no client certificate was presented.
      Set 'client-cert'/'client-key' or 'token-file'.
```

A token with the usual `write` role is enough. Everything iets uploads is
content-addressed: a source tree, a `builtins.toFile` text, a `.drv`. The
service computes the address itself and accepts the upload without a
signature, so you never need the `trusted` role.

## Build all the checks of a flake

Name the whole set. `iets build` builds every derivation in
it and picks the set for the current system itself:

```sh
iets build --builder 'grpc://farm.example.org:50051?max-builds=32' .#checks
```

Every check gets its own result, and one failure doesn't stop the others.
The builder doesn't rebuild anything it already has. On a gRPC builder,
`max-builds` in the URL sets how many builds run at once.

stderr ends with a one-line summary, such as `12 built, 1 failed:
checks.x86_64-linux.clippy`. The exit code is Nix's: 100 for a failed build.
For a program, `--json` puts `{"outcomes":[…]}` on stdout, one object per
check, with the end of the log for each failure.

## See what gets uploaded

iets writes nothing to a local store on the way out. It builds the closure
from what the evaluation holds in memory: the derivations, and the sources
from where the evaluation found them (the original local tree, the input
store, or a `builtins.toFile` text in memory). Anything the evaluation did
not add, such as a path pinned with `builtins.storePath`, is read from
`/nix/store` when possible and otherwise left to the daemon
([Builders and the wire](../reference/builders.md#what-iets-sends)). Before
it sends a source, iets checks that the tree still hashes to the planned
store path, and fails the build if it changed.

To watch the upload, add `--timings`:

```sh
iets build --impure --builder daemon --no-build --timings greeting.nix
```

After the `cache:` and `eval:` lines you get one line for each step of the
upload:

```
plan: 0 sources, 1 drvs, 0.000s
connect: protocol 1.38, trusted, 0.055s
query: 1 paths, 0 missing, 0.000s
add: 0 paths, 0 bytes, 0.000s
worker: 2 ops, 5 round trips, 240 bytes sent
```

`query` is one `QueryValidPaths` over every planned path. `add` is one
`AddMultipleToStore` of whatever that answer said was missing. That's the
whole upload: two operations.

## Upload without building

`--no-build` plans, asks and uploads, then stops before the build:

```sh
iets build --impure --builder daemon --no-build greeting.nix
```

It prints nothing when it succeeds. Add `--timings` to see the phases. Use it
to warm up a builder, or to check that a closure uploads cleanly before you
start the build.

`--dry-run` stops even earlier and tells you what *would* happen. Copy
`greeting.nix` to `farewell.nix` and change the name and message, so the
builder hasn't built it yet:

```sh
iets build --impure --builder daemon --dry-run --json farewell.nix
```

```json
{"downloadSize":0,"narSize":0,"unknown":[],"willBuild":["/nix/store/y8g88wvqxf4chh9hggwjmdrv0mqvgq8f-farewell.drv"],"willSubstitute":[]}
```

The plan is also on stderr as text, with or without `--json`:

```
this derivation will be built:
  /nix/store/y8g88wvqxf4chh9hggwjmdrv0mqvgq8f-farewell.drv
```

The JSON is byte for byte what `iets plumbing missing` prints
([Plumbing operations](../reference/plumbing.md)). If the builder already has
every output, as it does for `greeting.nix`, all the lists are empty.

Even with `--dry-run` or `--no-build`, the daemon may substitute a source it
needs, because it can't register the derivations without it.

## Get the outputs back

A remote builder keeps its outputs where it built them. To get them,
`--fetch-to DIR` streams each wanted output back into `DIR`:

```sh
iets build --impure --builder daemon --fetch-to out greeting.nix
ls out/
```

```
hl2d12ai352g88ad47fh8844g939iyrd-greeting
```

Each output lands under the base name of its store path. Nothing is
registered with a local daemon, so you don't need to be a trusted user.

To build only one output, use `--out NAME`. Repeat it to pick several
outputs of one derivation:

```sh
iets build --impure --builder daemon --out out -I nixpkgs=$nixpkgs -E '(import <nixpkgs> {}).hello'
```

```
/nix/store/xl1h9i29pgq2q5cszjhm5wpfxfbbqwyi-hello-2.12.3
```

## Build a .drv you already have

`iets build` also takes a `.drv` path. The closure then comes from
`/nix/store` instead of an evaluation:

```sh
iets build --builder daemon /nix/store/6jq7mz1b1n11y522nzjdqyvr3gwb69zz-greeting.drv
```

If an input source came from a local tree that the store does not have,
tell iets where to find it:

```sh
iets build --builder daemon --source /nix/store/…-src=./src /nix/store/…-thing.drv
```

What iets can't do over a transport is listed in
[Known limits](../reference/builders.md#known-limits).
