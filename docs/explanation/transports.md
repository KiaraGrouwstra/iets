# The transports, measured

How fast does `iets build` ship a closure, and how do you know the bytes
arrive intact? [Builders and the wire](../reference/builders.md) has the
facts about each transport. The numbers here come from one machine and drift
with the nixpkgs pin and the hardware, but the ratios and the op counts hold.

## Why one request per ready set

The worker protocol is serial per connection, and every
`BuildPathsWithResults` starts a new daemon worker. A request per derivation
would leave the daemon idle between derivations, so iets sends one request
for each set that is ready to build.

## Worker protocol timings

The figures come from `scripts/daemon-e2e.nu` on a release build.

"Local daemon" is this machine's `nix-daemon`, where the hello closure is
GC-rooted, so a cold run is impossible. "Scratch daemon" is
`nix-daemon --store local?root=DIR` on its own socket: an empty chroot
store, so the cold numbers are real uploads and no build is attempted
(`--no-build`). `ssh-ng://` is the same code over a child's stdio, tested
with an `ssh` shim that runs `nix-daemon --stdio` locally.

| case | eval | plan | connect | QueryValidPaths | AddMultipleToStore | build (realise) | ops / round trips | bytes sent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| custom drv + 1 source tree, deleted from the store, local daemon, `--fetch-to` | 0.005 s | 0.001 s | 0.077 s | 2 paths, 2 missing, 0.000 s | 2 paths, 2.4 KB, 0.001 s | 0.87 s | 6 / 9 | 2.9 KB |
| hello, local daemon (all valid) | 0.138 s | 0.006 s | 0.074 s | 776 paths, 0 missing, 0.008 s | skipped | 0.001 s | 4 / 7 | 62 KB |
| hello, scratch daemon, cold, `--no-build` | 0.159 s | 0.008 s | 0.020 s | 776 paths, 776 missing, 0.008 s | 776 paths, 2.6 MB, 0.247 s | skipped | 3 / 6 | 2.66 MB |
| hello, scratch daemon, warm, `--no-build` | 0.146 s | 0.007 s | 0.008 s | 776 paths, 0 missing, 0.011 s | skipped | skipped | 2 / 5 | 62 KB |
| nixos-desktop, scratch daemon, cold, `--no-build` | 1.48 s | 0.094 s | 0.015 s | 4,184 paths, all missing, 0.022 s | 4,184 paths, 40.4 MB, 1.89 s | skipped | 3 / 6 | 40.8 MB |
| nixos-desktop, scratch daemon, warm, `--no-build` | 1.65 s | 0.112 s | 0.055 s | 4,184 paths, 0 missing, 0.034 s | skipped | skipped | 2 / 5 | 333 KB |
| nixos-desktop, local daemon, `--no-build` | 1.21 s | 0.121 s | 0.081 s | 4,184 paths, 413 missing, 0.201 s | 413 paths, 23.2 MB, 1.67 s | skipped | 3 / 6 | 23.5 MB |

The 62 KB of a warm hello run is the `QueryValidPaths` request: 776 full
store paths as padded strings, and the 776 answers back. The custom drv's
0.87 s "build" is the sandbox build itself. The 413 paths the local daemon
lacked for nixos-desktop are nixpkgs subtrees that no local evaluation had
copied yet.

The upload is bound by the daemon: 0.3 to 0.5 ms per path for the sequential
`addToStore`. Nothing on the client side changes that
([What was tried and removed](history.md)).

### The upload changes no bytes

After an upload, `scripts/daemon-e2e.nu` checks that:

- the `.drv` file in the store is `cmp`-identical to the one
  `nix-instantiate` wrote before it was deleted;
- `nix-store -q --hash`, `nix derivation show` and `nix path-info --json`
  (`ca`, `narHash`, `narSize`, `references`) match for the derivation and
  for the source;
- in the scratch store, the hello derivation has the same hash as in the
  local store, and every input source has the same `ca`.

## The `grpc://` transport

The figures come from `scripts/grpc-e2e.nu` on a release build.

`nix-grpc-daemon` runs in plaintext standalone mode, scheduling onto itself,
in front of a scratch chroot store. These are the transport's own figures,
not a farm's.

| case | connect | QueryValidPaths | AddMultipleToStore | build | RPCs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| custom drv + 1 source tree, `--fetch-to` | 0.009 s | 2 paths, 2 missing, 0.020 s | 2 paths, 721 B, 0.009 s | 0.63 s | 6 |
| hello cold, `--no-build` | 0.000 s | 776 paths, 776 missing, 0.006 s | 776 paths, 490 KB, 0.26 s | skipped | 3 |
| hello warm, `--no-build` | 0.000 s | 776 paths, 0 missing, 0.006 s | skipped | skipped | 2 |

The cold hello upload is 490 KB on the wire, against 2.66 MB over the
worker protocol. The bytes are the same; `grpc://` sends them as one zstd
stream (level 1) across all 776 paths.

The script also checks that:

- classic `nix build --store grpc://…?insecure=1 --eval-store auto` prints
  the same stdout as the real nix with its nix-grpc-store plugin;
- an out-link whose output no local substituter has is fetched back with
  `FetchNars` and handed to the local daemon;
- `iets build --builder grpc://… --json` gives the same outcome per
  attribute as the worker protocol on the same store;
- a multi-root `iets build` over `grpc://` names every attribute on
  stderr.

Against `farm.numtide.com` with a Keycloak `write` token (measured
2026-09-20), a `runCommand` with 572 cached inputs went `Want`, `Assigned`,
`BuildDerivation` on a farm worker in 2.6 s and 5 RPCs. A classic
`nix-build` out-link came from cache.numtide.com through the local
daemon.

### Why bounced addresses are shared

A worker that crashed stays placeable until the scheduler notices. On
farm.numtide.com that took 42 s (measured 2026-09-22), and every bounce off
the dead worker was instant, so a client that only retried would burn its
retries in a second. All builds of one run therefore share what they learn
about an address ("Retries" in
[Builders and the wire](../reference/builders.md)).

## NAR parity


`tests/nar_parity.rs` checks that the NAR iets writes is byte-identical to
`nix-store --dump` on a tree of awkward names, empty files and directories,
symlinks, executables, odd alignment, deep nesting and a large file. It also
checks that a restored dump dumps back to the same bytes, and that the reader
rejects a truncated archive, a misspelled keyword and non-zero padding. Each
test skips itself when `nix` is absent.

On an AMD EPYC Genoa with a warm page cache, the pinned nixpkgs tree (40k
entries, 212 MB of NAR) and one 500 MB file (`bench/nar.nu --nix`):

| case | iets | Nix |
|---|---|---|
| NAR hash of the tree | 665-672 ms | `nix hash path` 1665 ms |
| dump of the tree, no hash | 545-567 ms | `nix-store --dump \| sha256sum` 2034 ms |
| NAR hash of a 500 MB file | 353-359 ms | `nix hash path` 386 ms |
| restore of the tree from a pipe | 1744-1804 ms | `nix-store --restore` 2019 ms |
